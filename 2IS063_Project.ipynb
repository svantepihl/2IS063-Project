        "In this project we investigated the sentiment regardning the presidential candidates of the US election 2020, Joeseph R Biden and Donald J Trump, on Twitter. The social media plattform Twitter is and has been highly influential on the policatal debate and elections in the US. We have retrevied a large dataset consisting of 1.7 million tweets with hashtags related to the candidates from the Data Science community Kaggle. The tweets were posted during October 15th to November 8th 2020.\n",

        "We clustered the data into 6 groups based on user follower count and hashtag. We then analysed the sentiment of the tweets using the model VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning). \n",
        "\n",
        "Our analysis indicated that the sentiment on Twitter were similarly distributed in all clusters for the two candidates. For both candidates the sentiment was more positive for users with high amounts of followers (>30 000)."

        "\n",
        "The organization we have chosen for this project is The Democratic Party in the US and the case is fictional. The Democratic Party was formed 1828 due to dissatisfaction with the central power of George Washington. The party dominated between 1829-1860. The democrats were divided on the issue of slavery and the result was that President Lincoln won and their 30 years long dominants in politics disappeared (Eliasson & Stranne n.d.).  \n",
        "\n",
        "After the civil war the Democratic Party was seen as conservative and had difficulty gaining power. In 70 years, they won the presidential election only four times. The turning point was when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president. The party changed their politics to create a social and welfare state. This resulted in a change in their voter base and southern voters with a conservative view switched to Republicans. The democrats have been continuing with this politics to this day (Eliasson & Stranne n.d.).  \n",
        "\n",
        "For the 2020 election, the Democrats nominated Joe Biden for president and The Republicans nominated Donald J. Trump. It was a tight race between the two presidential candidates (BBC 2020) and after days of voting, the primary result of the election shows that the people of the USA have chosen Joe Biden as their new president (Collinson & Reston 2020).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Based on interviews we have had with the Democrats, we understand that they find it difficult to reach voters on social media, especially on Twitter. They want to have information about the popularity of tweets regarding Biden and Trump. By observations on Twitter, Trump has more followers than Joe Biden which makes it easier for Trump to reach voters. Therefore they want our help to analyze how popular tweets regarding the 2020 presidential election have a positive or negative tone to Joe Biden. By analyzing tweets we hope to help Democrats to reach out more to voters on Twitter.   \n",

        "Social media has changed how we communicate and interact with one another but also our access to news. Twitter has over 348 millions active users that create over 500 millions tweets a day. Due to the popularity of the service, people are able to create trends that affect which news that will be reported the most. Because of the growing use, Twitter has become a critical communication tool for election campaigns. This kind of campaigning has increased in the last decade and politicians and political parties are “micro-blogging” their messages. The interest for researchers have also been increasing, election predictions based on Twitter data are a popular research area (Atluri V et al. 2020).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Politics can communicate through social media two ways: party centric och individually targeted. By micro-blogging politicians can reach out to their audience personally and engage voters, create opinions, and publish information. If the voters respond to the information, they will most likely contact the politicians and attend events. This is one of many reasons why politicians use social media as their platform to communicate with their voters (Dwivedi Y.K et al. 2019).  \n",
        "\n",
        "We’ve formed a fiction scenario for our data mining project. The Democratic Party in the US has been facing surprises and disappointments in recent years, and therefore want to know more about their voter base and how to get other political voters to vote for them. By doing so, the Democratic Party wishes to examine the outcome of the presidential election 2020 in relation to Twitter data. Specifically, the democrats would like to know whether the support on Twitter for the respective political parties differ based on users’ tweet popularity.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The results will be useful to the Democratic Party in future elections. Gaining knowledge about user sentiment in relation to popularity on Twitter is important in order to plan the electoral campaigns. Being aware of what users tend to be supportive of a certain presidential candidate determines where campaigning and presidential visit is of the most importance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The Democrats have initialized a project and hired an external group to preprocess twitter data from users that mentions the election and/or the political parties in their tweets. The task is to preprocess the retrieved data set containing information about 120 000 tweets from users in the US. We’ll also use data mining methods such as clustering to detect patterns in user sentiment and tweet popularity. "

By using social media, political actors and state institutions are provided a simple and low cost platform for reaching out to the public. Among the social media platforms of today, Twitter has become the most popular in terms of sharing information. For example, it’s being used by city governments to raise awareness and generate sentiment in a fast and cost effective way (Nooralahzadeh et al. 2013).  \n",

Nooralahzadeh et al. (2013) conducted a time series analysis where user tweets were examined in order to gain insights on the outcome of the US and France elections in 2012. In addition to this they also conducted a word cloud and hashtag analysis on the candidates and discussed topics to compare the two elections.   \n",

To do so, they employed a data analytics approach and collected over 3 million tweets for three weeks around the time of the election. The study aimed to examine if the contents of the tweets indicate users’ sentiment and opinion, and if the topics reflect important real-life events. They also estimate the sentiments of the candidates’ tweets during their campaigns and evaluate their impact on the overall sentiment of election-related discussion topics on Twitter (Yaquba et al. 2017).  \n",

        "To analyze our data we have chosen to use Cluster Analysis, and the method describes the group data objects and their relationships. The goal is to find objects that are similar to each other within the group and groups that are different to other groups. The greater the similarity the objects are in the group and the greater the difference between the groups, the better or more clear the clustering. Cluster Analysis is often referred to as unsupervised classification, and the reason for that is that clustering automatically divides data into clustering or groups without knowing how the groups should look in advance (Kumar V et. al, 2019).

First we choose K points as centroids, where K is the number of clusters desired. The next step is to assign each point to its closest centroid, and each collection of centroids are clusters. After that we update each cluster based on the points assigned to the cluster. We repeat this procedure until there are almost none or no changes at all in the centroids (Kumar V et. al, 2019).\n",

        "We chose Clustering Analysis and K-Means because we wanted to compare the difference between user segments, and their attitudes to each presidential candidate. After preliminary attempts to cluster using K-Means clustering we were unable to create clear and logical clusters and therefore we chose to create manual clusters based on followers. We created three groups: low group with 1000 followers or less, medium group with 1000 - 30 000 followers, and high group with 30 000 followers or more. We chose to divide them into groups to make it easier to visualize our data. We will focus on the medium and high group, and analyze the data based on sentiment analysis. This is because we believe that their tweets and message can have a greater chance of reaching more people. "

        "Text classification is a method for handling text data or other information from databases and is used for research purposes. Its main function is to classify text into defined categories, or classes, based on its content and labels. These types of techniques for processing information can be applied to several fields, for instance document management or to filter emails. Therefore, the use of these techniques are extremely useful to access and handle information (Ur-Rahman & Harding, 2012).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment analysis is a type of text classification where the main task is determining the sentiment of a text document by finding a correlation between the writer’s style and emotional state. In our case it will be the emotional state of the user’s tweet(s) posted on Twitter. The analysis considers the polarity of specific used keywords. The keywords’ polarity could be either positive, negative or neutral, for example “excellent”, “terrible” or “unbiased”. This technique is done by analyzing the contextual polarity of our collected tweets to categorize tweets about the two presidential candidates of the US Election 2020 into different emotional levels (Li et al. 2016).  \n",
        "\n",
        "The sentiment analysis approach will be used in our project to analyze the extracted data from our dataset. We chose this data mining method because we hope to discover useful information to present and discuss by categorizing our text documents (tweets). This will make the evaluation process easier. To discover sentiments in tweets we find this technique useful in terms of categorizing the positive, negative and neutral words in users’ tweets posted around the US election 2020 (Ur-Rahman & Harding, 2012)."

        "Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment tool that has been developed especially for social media texts. Not only does VADER tell us about positivity and negativity scores, but also how positive or negative the sentiment is. For example, when the word “good” appears with capital letters, the VADER tool will attach great importance to the fact that it is in capital letters, which means that “good” will have a greater positivity score. Also, VADER handles emojis and it’s expression. The tool is already a trained analysis, which means that training data are not required (Hutto C.J & Gilbert E.E, 2014).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the positive and negative scores we get from VADER, we can calculate a compound score. Compound scores can then be represented on a scale where -1 is the most extreme negative and 1 is the most positive value. This allows us to categorize the tweets sentiment into negative, positive and neutral groups. We chose to define the groups as follows, negative sentiment compound less than -0.05, positive sentiment compound more than 0.05, and neutral compound between -0.05 and 0.05. The VADER tool will be used in our project because it works well on social media, which is good in our case when we analyse texts from Twitter. Also, the tool is easy to use and we do not have to create any training data.  \n",

For Trump related hashtags we've used #Trump and #DonaldTrump, and for Biden related hashtags we've used #Biden and #JoeBiden. Here on forth, when mentioning Trump and Biden hashtags, we refer to both hashtags for each presidential candidate. We can observe that there are more tweets relating to Trump than Biden. This indicates that the Trump hashtag are able to generate more attention on Twitter. Next up let's compare the creation date of the Twitter accounts for the hashtags as this might be interesting to compare!"

This is substantially smaller than the other groups, but given their large follower base they may have a large impact on the overall sentiment on twitter. In this group the spread is very large. The accounts have, at most, around 5.25 millon followers and at the lowest around 30 000. This makes it difficult to plot using standard scales, as you can see in the second plot, which is why we logarithmized the x-axis to give us a meaningfull chart.\n",

Therefore, the K-Means method did not provide us with any useful information. Instead, we redefined “popularity” as the amount of followers the twitter user has.

Though, there are a few aspects to be critical of when evaluating the results and presenting our conclusion. Sentiment analysis is a complex process and could be challenging if the text documents in question are complicated. The data in tweets could be difficult to interpret, like the wrongful use of hashtags or if the choice of words sends the wrong message in terms of being positive, negative or neutral. For example, when a tweet speaks poorly of a presidential candidate but is followed with a hashtag for the opposite candidate, the tweet will be processed as a negative tweet for the opposite candidate even if this wasn’t the intention of the tweet itself. Hence, we’ve lost the semantic meaning of tweets in our analysis since our data mining method can’t take this into consideration.  \n",

The more irony used in tweets, the more negative impact it has on the results.\n"

The result of our sentiment analysis indicated that there is no substantial difference between the two presidential candidates, which doesn’t correlate with our hypothesis.

The fact that the analysis indicates an equal result is also reflected on the outcome of the election itself, where the number of votes were extremely equal between the two candidates.  \n",

The results of this study are in favor of what hoped to deliver to the Democratic Party. They have been provided with a study that shows that they are in fact reaching out to voters through the social media platform Twitter, and that they can (and should) continue to communicate via Twitter. This study has presented and discussed the great impact of the usage of social media platforms for communicating with voters and generating sentiment towards a political party and its presidential candidate. We hope that the Democratic Party will find this study useful for future campaigning.\n"

        "\n",
        "When an organization is processing users’ personal information, it’s important to consider the ethical aspects. Since Twitter is an organization that uses this type of data, they have a responsibility to process the data in a correct and ethical way. When we initialized our project we’ve had to take ethics into consideration as well because Twitter is the source of our dataset. Also, since our project is launched in Sweden, we have to follow the european General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This means processing the data in a correct way in relation to this law (Dryselius, n.d.). \n",
        "\n",
        "Twitter’s privacy policy can be found on their official website. When using Twitter in any way, they receive information about the user in terms of what device the user is on and its IP address. It’s also possible to share additional information to Twitter when creating an account, e.g. an email, phone number or location. In contrast, the user can change their settings and limit the amount of data that Twitter collects and how they use it (Williams et al. 2017). Twitter will also use information about users to find more relevant tweets, people to follow, and personalized ads. By looking at the tweets, likes, and retweets of a user, Twitter can determine a lot about the users’ personality. For instance, topics you’re interested in, and languages you speak and/or comprehend (Williams et al. 2017).  \n",
        "\n",
        "When pre-processing our dataset, we follow the guidelines of GDPR. This implies that we have the consent of the Twitter users to use their information. This consent is granted through Twitter’s own website when users accept their terms and conditions at the point of registration. Since the main purpose of this study is to examine different levels of sentiments in tweets, we don’t process the personal data about the actual users. Therefore, the information extracted from this analysis is not harmful to users from an ethical standpoint. This information is filtered out at an early stage in our project and is not used in the sentiment analysis. Though, there are a few other ethical aspects to consider.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, conducting this type of analysis on data could hinder the principle of free speech. The fact that studying twitter data has become a highly popular research area, more people are becoming aware that they’re under surveillance.  Expressing strong opinions, in this case about politics, could affect the users’ content in terms of feed, ads, people to follow etc. The effect this could have is the limitation of peoples’ transparent opinions on Twitter and lead to a negative impact on the social media industry as whole.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Another aspect is the bias of the analysis. People can make more subjective decisions than computers can. This means that despite the fact that computers can make objective decisions, it’s still indirectly subjective if a human being provides the basis of it. In order to preprocess our data and evaluate the results, several decisions have to be taken by people and therefore the data will be biased. With this process, information that could be of value will be left out without us knowing. \n"

Also, we visualize the tweets with a word cloud to determine which words that are used frequently in the tweets and plots."
